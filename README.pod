=head1 NAME

Plack::Middleware::Proxy::ByHeader - choose remote host by header

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $app = builder {
    enable "Proxy::ByHeader", 
        header  => [ 'X-Taz-Proxy-To', 'Host' ];
        allowed => [ 'example.com', 'www.example.com', 'www2.example.com' ];

    Plack::App::Proxy->new()->to_app;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plack::Middleware::Proxy::ByHeader examines the request header to set
the special environment variable I<plack.proxy.url> which is used by
Plack::App::Proxy to proxy the request.

If any of the header field names set with the option I<header> is present
in the request and if its value matches one of the allowed values,
I<plack.proxy.url> is set to the request uri with the hostname changed
to the value of the header field.

The first present header short circuits the check even its value is not
allowed. In this case the request is left unchanged.

If multiple headers with the same field name are present, the last
value is used.
